### What is devops?

devops combines develpoment (dev) and operations (ops) to to bring faster development and delivery of systems. it combines the tools, individuals and working practices of both development and operations, to deploy IT products at a pace that aligns with todays marketplace aswell as updating them to maximise performance. it uses agile development(working collaboratively completing work in brief sprints) and lean manufactuirng( reduces waste as much as possible)

### Benefits of devops?
- DevOps is big on collaboration and trust in order for the quick deployment of systems
- stabilize work environment: tensions involved in the release of new features and fixes can affect the stability of your workspace and decrease productivity
- improvement in product quality: because of the collabortaion between development and operations teams, theres also an improvement in the quality of the porduct due to user feedback
- Automation in reptitive tasks allows for more room for innovation
- continuos delivery of software: increased speed of software delivery due to collaboration
- fast and reliable problem-solving techniques: quick and stable solutions to technical errors in software management is on of the primary benefits of devops
- minimal cost of production: (lean manufacturing) both maintenance and updates are brought under a broader single umbrella.


### what does the role entail?

DevOps engineers deliver automated software components by identifying manual processes that can be automated and is responsible fro the optimizing an organisations software, including mainetnance and server adminstartion.
- developers are responsible for new product features bug fixes etc
- development and opertaions had poor communication and the key aspect of devops is having the two team work closely together to share responsibilitys, automating the pipeline and deploying the infrastructure as code.
-dev build and write products and tests an dstore into something like Git'-net step enageg with Ops to test on premise and on cloud. it is also stored onto GIT
- once tests have passed thee CI/CD server they aer deployed.

### who do devops engineers work with?

devops engineers work with IT departments, developers and operations team. ensuring collaboration for a faster delivery of systems and mainetnance

### what other teams does a devops engineer work with?

- Front-End Developers
- Back-End Developers
- UI/UX Developers
- Product Testers
- IT Operations Admins
- Security Admins
- Executives
- Customer Service Reps that deal with end-users


### what are their common deliverables?

- daily interactions with different departments
- infrastructure management (managing software automation)
- check slack for urgent messages
- work on automation backlog
- meet with team to discuss continuos imrpovements
- work on documentation

### what is the value of a DevOps engineer?
- helps business' to intergrate IT systems better (more user friendly)
- helps developers release system projects quicker by streamlining the development process
- automate repetitive internal processes
- helps design cyber-secure systems

### how do devops engineers fit into the SDLC?

SDLC stands for software development lifecycle
- prepares documentation for server-side features, which can make long-term system mainenance more efficient
- devops is an approach to improve work in the software development lifecycle process.  developers write ode that fulfills requirements and then deploys the application. tstakeholders and developers must communicate effectively about their projects and its requirements.


- easy of use : other teams are going to use the tools we create. they wont use them if they are not user friendly. == if the devs do not use our tools then there will be headaches/delays in deployment down the line.

- flexibility: it can be easy to get locked in to using a specific product, tool or software. And it then becomes hard for the company to keep up with industry changes == Everything the company uses should be easily changed or updated as the business needs change

- robustness: We need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company's services. == we are responsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers.

- cost: cost is often overlooked. we need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possible in its tech dealings == for example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task? do we need certain servers running? etc.

core jobs- make sure developers work in a system that can be controlled (also known as a development environment)

### A good development environment

- user friendly: perspective of whoevers going to use it, fast friendly and robust.
- it should be easy to update: devs adding new features to whatever theyre building they might need to add on to it.
- should match the production environment as closely as possible: so you can catch all the bugs and issues earlier and before you deploy
(production environment= where its going to run for the users)
- it should be the same for everyone everywhere
(soo many people working on it so you want evreyone to have the same area, makes troubleshooting as simplpe as possible)- no dreaded "it works on my machine!"(works on some but not others)
- it should only support one application. (no conflicts-- application1 needs version1.1 of a program but application2 needs 1.2 of the same programme. can break either application )
